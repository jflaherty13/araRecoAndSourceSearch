***NOTE***: Opening default SQLite database for 2013-2017. Unixtime argument is 0. If you want the correct channel mappings for ARA03 & ARA01 for 2018 & after please specify either: 
a) The right year when you call AraGeomTool::getStationInfo(3,2017) where 3 is stationID and 2017 is DB year
OR
b) Call UsefulAtriStationEvent *realAtriEvPtr = new UsefulAtriStationEvent(rawAtriEvPtr, AraCalType::kLatestCalib); ***BEFORE***

   The StreamerInfo of class Settings read from file /fs/scratch/PAS0654/jorge/sim_results/Chiba_antModel/AraOut.default_A2_c1_E560.txt.run60.root
   has the same version (=1) as the active class but a different checksum.
   You should update the version to ClassDef(Settings,2).
   Do not try to write objects with the current class definition,
   the files will not be readable.
